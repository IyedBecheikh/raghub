## Development Setup

See [SETUP.md](SETUP.md) for detailed setup instructions.

## Code Style

### TypeScript

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Avoid `any` types - use proper typing
- Use interfaces for object shapes
- Prefer `const` over `let`

### React/Next.js

- Use functional components
- Use Server Components by default, Client Components only when needed
- Follow the App Router patterns
- Keep components small and focused

### Styling

- Use Tailwind CSS utility classes
- Follow the existing color scheme
- Ensure responsive design (mobile-first)
- Use shadcn-ui components when possible

### File Organization

- One component per file
- Group related files in directories
- Use clear, descriptive names
- Follow the existing structure:
  ```
  app/          - Pages and routes
  components/   - Reusable components
  lib/          - Utilities and helpers
  ```

## Testing

Currently, the project doesn't have automated tests, but we welcome contributions to add:

- Unit tests (Jest/Vitest)
- Integration tests
- E2E tests (Playwright)

## Documentation

When adding features:

- Update README.md if needed
- Add JSDoc comments for functions
- Update SETUP.md for setup changes
- Create examples for complex features
